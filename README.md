# EDA and Data Visualization - IPL Matches

Welcome to the EDA and Data Visualization project focused on IPL (Indian Premier League) Matches! This repository contains code and resources for exploring and visualizing IPL match data using Python.

## Introduction

The Indian Premier League (IPL) is one of the most popular cricket leagues globally, featuring exciting matches between top cricketing teams. This project aims to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization on IPL match data to uncover insights, trends, and patterns.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about IPL matches, including match outcomes, teams, players, venues, and performance statistics. Each match record includes various attributes such as match URL, teams involved, match result, player of the match, innings details, and more.

## Project Goals

- Explore the IPL match dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
- Perform in-depth analysis to uncover trends, patterns, and insights related to IPL matches.
- Visualize key metrics and relationships using charts, graphs, and interactive plots.
- Extract actionable insights that can inform strategic decisions for teams, players, and stakeholders.

## Contents
